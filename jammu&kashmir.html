        Himalayan landscapes, serene lakes, lush valleys, and vibrant cultural heritage.<br><br>
        Jammu and Kashmir is divided into three distinct regions: Jammu, Kashmir Valley, and Ladakh, 
        each with its unique geography and climate. The Kashmir Valley, with its verdant meadows, dense forests,

        is a high-altitude desert known for its stark beauty, barren landscapes, and ancient monasteries perched atop 
        rugged mountains.<br><br>
